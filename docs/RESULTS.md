# Results snapshot (code intentionally omitted)

This repository contains **inputs and outputs** from a pilot analysis of a putative **overlapping/cryptic ORF motif window (W1)** versus a **backbone window (W2)** in **FMDV (Picornaviridae)**, followed by **topology tests** and **recombination scans**.

## Key outputs included
- **W1/W2 FASTA sets** (per-accession)
- **MAFFT alignments** (W1/W2)
- **IQ-TREE2 trees** and **AU/SH test reports**
- **RDP5/GARD exports** (as produced by the tools)
- **Breakpoint-window split datasets** + per-window trees (WIN1/WIN2)

## Headline finding (high level)
- **AU/SH**: W1 data strongly rejects the W2 topology (topology decoupling).
- **Recombination scan**: evidence of breakpoints (tool-specific; see exported reports).
- **Window trees**: breakpoints split the region into sub-windows with different phylogenetic signals.

> Note: This repo is an “evidence package”. Reproduction scripts/notebooks are intentionally not published here to avoid confusion about AI-generated code; methods are described in `docs/`.
